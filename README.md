# doublesnake

A multiplayer variant of Snake for iOS, over Bluetooth

Double Snake features single and two-player modes as well as various gameplay options to customize the multiplayer experience such as win conditions. Most of the gameplay details are integrated into the help interface of the game itself.

Primary emphasis for development on this project is restyling the interface as well as a potential rewrite of the visual system. The existing system is too dependent on hardware display parameters, so other avenues such as SpriteKit are being explored.
